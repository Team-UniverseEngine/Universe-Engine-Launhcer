# Herro!
The launcher is going on a full re-code and full User Interface redesign. <br>
Launcher is going for either a `C++`, `Python`, `C#` or `C` code re-work. <br>
We also would want to make it cross-platform compatible with wine working. <br>

## Other note to remember:
As of right now, we do not have any MacOS testers for Universe Engine.
We are not hiring and we will not invite anyone unless we feel like doing so. <br>
If you want updates about Universe Engine, please go check at the discord server <br>

## If you really wanted to help
Please, do a PR on the `new` branch. <br>

Thank you for your time to read this and have a great rest of your day. <br>
